# Find your way

The main focus is _accessibility_ and _progressive enhancement_. The main functionality should work without javascript. The page should also be _responsive_. 

### Restrictions
You can search for **London**. Without javascript the pages submits to a static html page. With javascript you get static data. There is no backend in the scope of this project. 

### Reflections
I use BEM to get a modular and well structured style. The semantics also help me with afterthought as to what I am building. 

Because of the scope of this project I am not using a library or framwork to change data in the DOM. If this was a large project I would not do it this way beacuse I would not want to tie my data to the DOM in this way.
